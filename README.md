## 📌 Project Context
This project was developed as an activity for **Intermediate Programming (Java)** during my **2nd Term** as a BSIT-MWA student at **National University - MOA**. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in Graphical User Interface (GUI) development, event handling, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 📝 Project Overview
**Pokémon: Moonveil** is a Java-based desktop application featuring a custom-designed user interface. It serves as a management system where users can register, log in, and browse through a Pokémon Pokédex-style dashboard with real-time stat tracking.

Built with **Java Swing**, this project focuses on clean UI design, robust validation logic, and efficient state management.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔐 Secure User System:** Complete **Sign Up** and **Log In** functionality with credential validation (length checks, matching passwords, and required terms).
* **📊 Interactive Pokédex:** A dynamic **Home** dashboard where users can cycle through Pokémon (Ditto, Mewtwo, Lunala) and view their HP, Defense, Attack, and Special Stats.
* **⚙️ Account Management:** A **Settings** page that allows users to update their personal information (First Name, Last Name, Username) which reflects across the entire system.
* **🎨 Custom Aesthetic UI:** Uses a consistent color palette (`#E6E8F0` / `#1B1F3B`) to provide a modern, "Moonveil" inspired experience.
